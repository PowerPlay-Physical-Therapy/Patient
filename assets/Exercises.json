Position your wrists so that the top wrist is held in extension and bottom in wrist flexion. Next, lower your arms and turn the Flexbar horizontal and line up your wrists so that your knuckles are pointed forward. This should place a twist tension through the bar. Then, allow your affected wrist to slowly relax and extend, thereby untwisting the bar slowly for an eccentric contraction to the wrist flexors.",
